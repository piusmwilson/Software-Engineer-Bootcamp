##Glossary of Key Terms

Here are some valuable terms for software development:

- Agile software development: An iterative and collaborative approach to creating software that emphasizes flexibility, customer feedback, and incremental delivery of functional components. Over the past few decades, it has been the go-to standard for development teams. I recommend the Agile Software Development course to learn more about agile.
- Automation: Using tools and scripts to perform repetitive tasks, such as checking for coding standard violations, running tests, or identifying potential bugs. It reduces manual effort and allows you to reduce friction during code reviews.
- Code review: The process of team members examining each other’s source code to identify bugs, ensure coding standards are followed, and improve overall code quality. It fosters knowledge sharing, enhances collaboration, and helps maintain a consistent codebase. 
- Computer programmers: Programmers design, develop, and test software.
- Integrated development environment (IDE): A software application used by programmers to write code for the project. Similar to project management software, IDEs can be simple or come with numerous features to aid a programmer in developing software applications.
- Legacy code: Code that you're afraid to change. Why? It could be that the code is not up to date with the latest software practices and design, the code is too complicated to understand, and/or the tests are insufficient to feel confident in making changes.
- Library: Code that someone else has written and verified. Libraries are essential for modern software development, because otherwise, we would solve the same fundamental problems repeatedly.
- Object-oriented programming: Involves using code to represent real-world things and situations
- Programming language: A way of providing instructions to a computer, written in text, and based on a set of rules
- Project management software: A tool that allows software teams to define each task of a project, assign it to the appropriate person, and monitor the time it takes to complete
- Pull request (PR): How a developer submits proposed changes to a codebase for review and approval before merging them into the main codebase
- Software: The programs and operating instructions used by any computing device
- Software development lifecycle (SDLC): The various processes related to software design, development and delivery. It allows companies to produce software of high quality in a timely and efficient manner.
- Software standards: Established guidelines or best practices that ensure consistency, quality, and compatibility in software development. They serve as a baseline for decision-making, help reduce uncertainty, and save time, as everyone clearly understands expectations.
- Source code: The human-readable computer instructions written by programmers in plain text
- Variable: A space in a computer’s memory where we can put data that we want to use as a reference for later
- Version control: The practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. Version control systems, or VCS, are software tools that help software teams manage code changes over time.

- Application Inventory: A database serving as a single source of truth, tracking all applications, their components, and interrelationships within an organization
- Architectural Design: The process of identifying and integrating system components to create a cohesive and functional solution
- Business Architecture: The practice of modeling and documenting relationships between people, capabilities, and processes within a business
- Business Capability: A specific function or service a business can perform, such as accounting, human resources, or vendor management
- Business Process: A series of steps or activities performed to achieve a specific business outcome, such as processing a customer order or onboarding a new employee
- Decision Tree: A visual representation of decision-making steps, guiding the selection of appropriate technology components based on specific criteria
- Enterprise Architecture (EA): A discipline that aligns business strategy with IT implementation to ensure technology supports organizational goals
- Enterprise Architect: A professional responsible for designing, planning, and overseeing the implementation of an organization's technology architecture
- Enterprise Architecture Management System (EAMS): A software platform that supports EA activities, such as application portfolio management, technology lifecycle management, and standards development
- Enterprise Planning: The process of aligning IT systems and technology investments with business strategy and objectives, both in the long-term and within specific business domains
- Enterprise Standards: A set of guidelines and best practices for technology selection, implementation, and management within an organization
- Reference Architecture: A generic representation of a system or solution, providing a template for design and implementation using enterprise standards
- Shadow IT: IT projects or systems developed and implemented outside of the formal IT governance and control processes
- Statement of Work (SOW): A document outlining the scope, deliverables, and timeline for a specific project or engagement, serving as a contract between EA and stakeholders
- Technology Lifecycle: The various stages a technology component goes through, from its initial introduction to its eventual obsolescence and retirement

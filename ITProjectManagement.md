# IT PROJECT MANAGEMENT

## INTRODUCTION

IT project managers are adaptable and resourceful leaders. Carrying complex projects over the finish line isn’t an easy task, but the right leader does it time and time again.

As an IT project manager, you create user-friendly and flexible technology for consumers while also tracking the progress of your team members. How do you do it all, we wonder? We’re guessing your secret is [IT project management software](https://asana.com/uses/project-management).

Having the right IT management software can be the key to project success. Our guide outlines what IT project management is and provides tips for managing IT projects.

**WHAT IS AN IT PROJECT?**

**An information technology (IT) project is a type of project that deals with IT infrastructure, information systems or computers.** Examples of an IT project include web development, software development, mobile app development, network configuration, software implementation, hardware installation, database management, and IT emergency recovery.

**What is IT project lifecycle?**

The project lifecycle of a typical IT project moves through iterations of several activities. These include planning, executing and controlling until the project is ultimately closed and transferred into operations. Organizations can select one of several popular approaches to reduce the risk of expensive rework, risks from quickly changing technology, or expansive planning at project launch.

The approaches align to three distinct IT project management lifecycles.

**What is predictive lifecycle?**

This is the most common, traditional project lifecycle for IT projects. In this approach, the PM and project team first define the project scope, project schedule and expected costs before project execution begins. As part of the project planning, each phase of the project should be clearly defined. Each phase involves a specific type of project work. For the project to move from its initiation to closure, each phase must be started and completed in the specific order as planned. This is named the [Waterfall approach](https://www.theserverside.com/tip/Scrum-vs-Waterfall-Whats-the-difference) as the project "waterfalls" down the project phases.

**What is iterative lifecycle?**

This approach requires that the project management be defined early, but cost and activity duration estimates are planned at a higher level. As project execution occurs, cost and duration estimates are created for the most imminent work through iterative planning. This approach also calls for iterations of benefits to be released to the organization. An iterative lifecycle may create a new software with more features provided in each new release.

**What is adaptive lifecycle?**

This project lifecycle also uses an iteration of planning and executing, but the planning may last for two to four weeks. This approach uses a rolling wave of planning and executing through short bursts of both planning and executing. Change is expected in this approach to the IT project and it is ideal for software development projects. [Agile project management](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/Agile-Manifesto) and [Scrum](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/definition/Scrum) are examples of the adaptive lifecycle.

A variant of the Agile approach is the [Kanban framework](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsoftwarequality/tip/Applying-Kanban-principles-to-software-development), which has a philosophy of continuous improvement and uses "Kanban boards" to visually show where project activities are in the course of the overall project.

Each of these lifecycles uses the concept of phases to move the project work forward. A phase describes the type of work that will occur in that portion of the project. The PM, the organizational requirements and even [customer requirements can influence selection](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/news/2240226779/Two-speed-IT-marries-agile-and-waterfall-development-approaches) of the types of project lifecycle the PM will adapt in the project.

**WHAT IS IT PROJECT MANAGEMENT?**

IT project management is the process of managing, planning, and developing information technology projects. IT projects exist within a variety of industries, including software development, information security, information systems, communications, hardware, network, databases, and mobile apps.

IT project developers deliver a product or service, while managers handle IT project management. Managers are in charge of communicating expectations and keeping projects on track and on budget to ensure the IT projects run smoothly.

IT project management (ITPM) is the planning, scheduling, execution, monitoring and reporting of IT projects. While many industries focus exclusively on IT projects, IT is unique in that most, if not all, industries have some level of an IT component.

Since they are often very wide in scope, IT project managers must deal with risk, interdependent integrations, software updates, scope creep and so on. Therefore, IT projects require more than the typical project management tools and skills to complete.

Specialized IT project management software complete with online Gantt charts, kanban boards, dashboards and reports provide the essential functions necessary for successful IT projects.

WHAT ARE THE 5 PHASES OF IT PROJECTS?

As an IT project manager, you can accomplish complex tasks more effectively using the five phases of IT project management. Each phase has different milestones that drive the project life cycle forward. Whether you’re managing sprints for an [Agile project](https://asana.com/resources/agile-project-management) or process rollouts—map out your next project using the five phases below.

1\. Initiation

During the [initiation phase](https://asana.com/resources/project-initiation), determine the need for the project and create a project proposal. The project must also be viable for the team and the company at large. During this phase, make sure to also confirm the project is worth the allotted time and resources before moving forward.

2\. Planning

The planning phase is a collaborative effort between you as the IT project manager and your team. Planning for the project involves setting budgets, identifying risks, and creating clear goals for what you hope to accomplish.

A [roadmap template](https://asana.com/templates/for/product/product-roadmap) can help you plan goals that you can then refer to throughout the project life cycle.

3\. Execution

The execution phase is when the team sets deliverables for the project. IT project managers play a crucial role by delegating tasks to hit milestones and keeping communication open among all team members.

Use [team collaboration software](https://asana.com/resources/best-team-collaboration-software) to ensure everyone is on the same page about who’s doing what by when. You may need to revisit the project plan during execution, as projects often experience changes during development.

4\. Monitor and control

During the execution phase, use IT project management software to track your team’s progress in real time. This involves monitoring the time, cost, scope, quality, and risk of the project itself. Using your [project roadmap](https://asana.com/resources/project-roadmap), you can evaluate whether the project is on track with your project proposal and goals, or course-correct if necessary.

5\. Closure

Once the project is complete, the closure phase begins. In this phase, ensure all work has been completed, approved, and moved on to the appropriate team. It’s also important to take some time to review any [lessons learned](https://asana.com/resources/lessons-learned) during the project and determine what went well and what didn’t. The closure phase is crucial because it empowers your team to review and improve future methodology.

WHAT DOES AN IT PROJECT MANAGER DO?

A typical [IT project manager](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/IT-project-manager) (PM) spends their day in meetings, reviewing project activities against the plan, orchestrating activities to correct project issues, monitoring progress against the budget, providing status reports to stakeholders, and briefing business unit leaders and senior management, among many others.

Regular meetings with IT department heads on the project team are especially important, as their contributions influence greatly whether the project is completed as planned. Discussions with vendors supporting the project are also important, especially when checking on deliveries of components and checking expenses again the budget,

The PM must also [act as a cheerleader](https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/tip/The-non-tech-skills-of-software-development-project-managers) for the project, motivating project team members and IT employees supporting the project.

If the PM is using a software package to monitor the project, regular daily visits to the system are needed to ensure things are on track. The PM will likely spend time on the system after hours to identify issues that might need attention before they create a problem in the project schedule.

As an IT project manager, you must know how to communicate with everyone in your organization. You’ll be working closely with members of the IT department, but you may also be in charge of discussing your team’s work with other teams.

- Ensure the product functions: The goal of every IT project is to deliver a functional product that meets the customer’s needs. IT project managers are the first point of contact if things go wrong with a project, which is why you must prioritize functionality above all else.
- Assign tasks to team members: A project manager is a team’s go-to person when determining what their [roles and responsibilities](https://asana.com/resources/roles-and-responsibilities) are for the project. As an IT project manager, take some time to understand IT teams so you can assign tasks effectively.
- Track progress and performance: Once each project begins, project management professionals must track team performance, the [project timeline](https://asana.com/resources/create-project-management-timeline-template), the budget, and how well the project is meeting its goals. IT project managers can use [project management software](https://asana.com/resources/best-project-management-software) to assess competencies and assist with professional development.
- Lead Agile meetings with stakeholders: A [stakeholder](https://asana.com/resources/project-stakeholder) is often influenced by the outcome of the project. This could be senior management, a customer, or a product tester. As IT project manager, you’ll communicate with stakeholders and give them frequent status reports on the project.  

CHALLENGES FACED BY IT PROJECT MANAGERS

You’ll face a fair number of challenges in your role as IT project manager, but with the right management tools, you can feel confident in your ability to address issues quickly

- Changing technology
- Risk Management
- Miscommunication
- Scope Creep
- Time and Budget

**Changing technology**

Complex IT projects can take months or years to complete. One challenge in IT project management is keeping up with transforming technology as a project takes place. The [project scope](https://asana.com/resources/project-scope) of your initial IT project must be flexible in case the needs of your customer change while your project is in development.

- Scenario: Your team takes on a long-term project to improve the GPS systems in cars. While working on this project, GPS phone apps come out allowing drivers to see traffic in real time. Your GPS system doesn’t include traffic, and including this feature would considerably extend your project length.
- Solution: Changing technology can’t be stopped, so your IT project must be flexible. In this example, your team would need to decide whether pivoting the project is a good business strategy to compete with advanced GPS phone technology.

**Risk management**

Managing the risks of an information technology project is a necessary step in the initiation phase. During this phase, you must come up with alternate plans should your initial goals fall short. If you don’t manage risk on the front end, you’ll have a hard time picking up the slack when things go awry in real time.

- Scenario: Your team creates an online scheduling portal for patients at a hospital. You predict everything will run smoothly, so you’re shocked when a bug in the program causes cardiac patients to see gynecologists and neuro patients to see urologists.
- Solution: With proper risk management, a plan is in place to quickly and effectively resolve the bug. Fixing the bug also means reassessing and identifying potential new risks raised by the fix. Risk analysis is an essential part of IT project management—try using a [risk register](https://asana.com/resources/risk-register) to identify risks before they occur.

**Miscommunication**

Because IT project managers function as the go-between among team members, departments, and stakeholders, miscommunication can become a challenge if there isn’t an organized process in place to keep everyone informed. Prioritize communication using IT project management tools to lead your team to success.

- Scenario: Your company agrees to work with a local school and improve their learning spaces with increased access to technology. The project involves installing Wi-Fi and donating 100 computers to the school, but your senior manager thought you were only donating 10 computers.
- Solution: Prioritize communication at the beginning of a project. Sharing frequent project status updates with IT management tools can ensure everyone is on the same page through the project life cycle.

**Communication**

Another hurdle that IT project management has to clear is communication between teams. This is a problem with all projects, frankly, but with IT there are often distributed teams who work remotely, often in different time zones, which only aggravates the situation. Having clear and effective communication channels is key for success on any IT project.

**Transparency**

Transparency is important, too, as the focus in IT is sharp. Having transparency across the project, with clear deadlines, helps teams better incorporate new technology or respond to change quickly and effectively.

**Lack of Agreement on Methodology**

But one of the biggest issues is that many organizations aren’t applying IT project management to their projects, which is like sailing a ship without a rudder. Without a process or methodology, whatever that might be, projects go off-track and over budget. Having an IT project manager who defines process, roles and tools is the first step to the success of an IT project.

**Scope creep**

[Scope creep](https://asana.com/resources/what-is-scope-creep) occurs when the original goals of the project become overshadowed if stakeholders continue adding new requirements and deliverables. It can potentially derail a project and requires constant maneuvering.

To reduce the frequency of scope creep, set strong project objectives from the beginning, have a [change control process](https://asana.com/resources/change-control-process) in place, and do your best to communicate with stakeholders every step of the way.

- Scenario: Your initial project goal was to improve outdoor Wi-Fi at your company’s headquarters so employees and visitors can work from anywhere. During project execution, stakeholders ask you to expand the outdoor Wi-Fi reach to the operations center across the street and also allow download capabilities.
- Solution: IT project management can give clear project objectives at the start, so your stakeholders will know what can be accomplished during this project. For example, they would understand that requesting an extension of the outdoor Wi-Fi reach is reasonable, while requesting download capabilities is too extensive.

**Time and budgeting**

Time and budgeting are some of the biggest challenges you may face in IT project management. Without realistic deadlines for a project, you risk delivering a product or service that is of lower quality than it could be.

Not having the resources to complete the project can also make teams and customers suffer. You can reduce time and budgeting challenges by prioritizing these items in the planning phase.

- Scenario: Senior management would like your team to perform a company-wide software migration within one month, but you’ll need an additional month because your team is too small and inexperienced to complete the migration in the allotted time frame.
- Solution: Use IT project management software to keep senior management informed about your team’s availability and experience. That way, management can prepare a more realistic timeline when assigning IT projects.

TYPES OF IT PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOLS

IT project management tools can keep your project team organized and informed from project initiation to closure. These tools help visualize each team member’s role in the project and show the project’s progress in real time.

**For all types of IT projects:**

- RACI chart: RACI stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. Using a [RACI chart](https://asana.com/resources/raci-chart), you can clarify the roles and responsibilities of your team members when working through projects. For each task or deliverable, designate which team members or stakeholders are Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, or Informed. These charts can be useful in all types of IT projects, as there’s always a need for clarification among team member responsibilities.  

**For projects with task dependencies:**

- Gantt chart: A [Gantt chart](https://asana.com/resources/gantt-chart-basics)—named after Henry Gantt—is a horizontal chart used to illustrate a project timeline. Each bar on the chart represents tasks in the project, and the length of each bar represents time. Gantt charts help teams visualize what work needs to get done and how tasks affect one another, like a waterfall. If your project involves many [dependent tasks](https://asana.com/resources/project-dependencies) (in other words, tasks that rely on one another), then this is a great tool because your team members can see if and where tasks overlap.

**For projects that require tasks with small, incremental changes:**

- Kanban boards: Kanban boards show the [work breakdown structure](https://asana.com/resources/work-breakdown-structure) of what stage each task is in. Using Kanban boards in IT project management can help your team balance their work responsibilities and see other team members’ available capacity. [Kanban boards](https://asana.com/resources/what-is-kanban) work well when your project requires tasks with small, incremental changes. These task boards allow teams to break down tasks into checklists and progress stages.

WHAT IS AN EXAMPLE OF IT PROJECT MANAGEMENT?

An information technology team is developing a new iPhone application to help employees clock in at work. When putting together the project proposal for the iPhone app, the IT project manager consults with the app creator while also considering the needs of the end user.

In this IT project example, we’ll use the five phases of project management to bring the iPhone app through development.

- [Initiation phase](https://asana.com/resources/project-initiation): The first step is to ask questions. Dig deep into how the app will help solve a problem. Consider how this iPhone app can provide a solution for employees and employers. Is creating this app viable for your team given the designated time and budget?
- [Planning phase](https://asana.com/resources/project-management-plan): Next, you begin the planning phase. To do so, determine the budget it will take to make the app and assess who on your team can handle the coding of the app.
- Execution phase: The most important part of executing the plan for your iPhone app is to identify your overall project objectives. In this example, your project objective is: “The goal of this time-tracking application is to provide an easily accessible way for employees to clock their work hours and to help employers keep track of their team’s productivity.”
- Monitor, control, and closure phases: Use [IT project management tools](https://asana.com/teams/it) to monitor your team’s progress. With effective project management software, you can look back at the data during the closure phase.

**HOW TO MANAGE AN IT PROJECT**

While there are many ways to manage an IT project, some aspects are universal. The steps might be slightly different, but the general direction is the same.

We’ll walk you through these steps one-by-one, while illustrating how a project management software can help you along the way.

1\. Collect Requirements

Before a project can begin, paperwork is required. You need to define scope, create a budget and determine the stakeholder requirements. All these documents can be attached to the project on our software, which has unlimited file storage.

2\. Select Team

Now that you’ve collected the project’s requirements, you can assemble a team with the skills and experience that fit the task at hand. Be sure to onboard them into your project management software, so communication happens in one place.

3\. Use a Gantt Chart

Use a Gantt to add tasks to a [timeline](https://www.projectmanager.com/project-timeline), link dependencies, set milestones and view the critical path. We offer a [fully-featured online Gantt chart](https://www.projectmanager.com/software/gantt-chart) for project managers who work in a waterfall environment. The whole team doesn’t have to use this traditional planning tool though, as project data is shared across multiple project views: task lists, calendars and kanban boards.

4\. Use a Kanban Board

Use a [kanban board](https://www.projectmanager.com/software/kanban) to control workflow during project execution. With ProjectManager, you can create workflows, execute sprints and work in an agile framework without disturbing the Gantt plan.

5\. Monitor Progress

As the project moves forward, it’s important that the actual progress matches what was planned. Our software has a [real-time dashboard](https://www.projectmanager.com/software/dashboard) that collects data as it’s updated. We automatically crunch the numbers and display them in charts that show costs, tasks, health and more. Project tracking has never been easier.

6\. Manage Workload

IT projects require smart workload management. Are team members overtasked or have they too few assignments? To avoid slowing progress, our workload page shows you who’s on holiday and who has too much work: you can even reassign tasks right from the page.

7\. Make Changes

Projects aren’t static. You have to pivot fast when there are change requests from stakeholders. Our software gives your plans and your team flexibility. For example, if a date changes, simply drag and drop the task to the new deadline on the Gantt chart. This change is then reflected throughout the software.

8\. Get Reports

To track progress and keep stakeholders updated, our software has an [in-depth reporting feature](https://www.projectmanager.com/software/reporting). There are many reports, that can be generated to help with IT project management. Make an in-depth [status report](https://www.projectmanager.com/status-report) with just a few clicks to get the information you need.

**MANAGING THE PROJECT KNOWLEDGE AREAS**

There are ten knowledge areas where a PM is expected to deliver value throughout the project:

- **Project scope management.** The scope is defined, documented and approved. It's protected from unauthorized changes, edited with approved changes and validated by stakeholders for project acceptance.
- **Project schedule management.** The schedule is defined first by the working hours of the project, any milestones and a deadline. The project team's availability throughout the project is documented and planned accordingly. The PM works with the project team to identify the tasks and task duration estimates to create a timeline.
- **Project costs management.** Project costs are estimated so a budget can be set. These costs include materials, pricing, services, facilities, [software licenses](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcio/definition/software-license) and other expenses attributed directly to the project.
- **Project quality management.** What constitutes quality is defined in specific metrics and agreed upon among the stakeholders as early in the project as possible. [Quality assurance](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/feature/How-AI-changes-quality-assurance-in-tech) programs and policies direct the work, while quality control inspects the work to confirm that the quality measures are met.
- **Project human resources management.** The PM works with the project team to verify that IT team members are completing their assignments and leveraging their knowledge while working well with others. The PM informs managers of these contributors about their participation and performance.
- **Project communications management.** Stakeholders will rely on the PM for information throughout the project lifecycle. PMs skilled in this knowledge area typically create a communications management plan to address who will need what information, when the information is needed and what modality is best for the communications.
- **Project risk management.** Risks are situations, events and conditions that can threaten or sometimes benefit IT project objectives. [Risk management](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/What-is-risk-management-and-why-is-it-important) involves identifying and analyzing risks as well as creating a response for each risk event. The probability and impact of each risk event is evaluated to create a risk score to justify the costs needed to manage the risk event.
- **Project procurement management.** Should the project need to purchase goods or services, a formal process for procurement is necessary. The plan should address contract type and administration, purchasing audits, and contract closeout. Many PMs do not manage procurement, instead deferring to the organization's centralized procurement or purchasing department and processes.
- **Project stakeholder management.** Stakeholders include anyone with a vested interest in the project. Stakeholder management is the identification of, inclusion of and communication with the groups of stakeholders. The goal is to manage concerns the stakeholders might have.
- **Project integration management.** This involves the coordination of the events in all the other knowledge areas. How well the PM performs in one knowledge area directly affects the performance of the other areas. Project [integration](https://www.techtarget.com/searchcustomerexperience/definition/integration) management examines the interactions and contingencies among the knowledge areas to ensure the project is adequately planned, executed, controlled and closed.
- **Project completion and reporting to IT management.** As the project reaches completion, the PM should be prepared to close out the project as completed, providing evidence verifying that the new system is in production and performing as expected as well as closing out any connections between internal and external participants. The PM should also prepare a report to senior management and IT management on the project's completion, citing issues that were addressed and lessons learned, explaining how the new system will benefit the organization, and recommending follow-up steps.

Except for procurement, all these knowledge areas will be relevant in every project. They can occur iteratively, and there is no set order for managing them. PMs shift to the appropriate knowledge and processes based on what's occurring in the project.

**IT PROJECT MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE**

Building an IT project plan can occur with tools as rudimentary as an Excel spreadsheet or as advanced as [Microsoft Project](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Microsoft-Project-Microsoft-Office-Project). The former is useful for simple projects; the latter can be scaled to support large, complex projects.

More sophisticated systems are available to handle just about any kind of project. Organizations should take advantage of a free demo if the vendor offers it before making a purchase. One project management software system to consider is [Wrike](https://www.techtarget.com/searchvirtualdesktop/news/252495111/Citrix-to-acquire-Wrike-for-225-billion), a cloud-based system that supports all sizes of projects. Other flexible, scalable online project management tools include Project Insight, BigTime and [Monday.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterprisedesktop/news/252505447/Mondaycom-brings-document-editing-to-project-management).

Check out [open source products](https://www.computerweekly.com/news/366569553/The-outlook-for-open-source-Growing-but-there-are-challenges) also. Most vendors offer free and paid versions. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) elements into PM software is an important advancement. PMs will appreciate AI for its ability to anticipate potential problems before they occur.

**CREATING A PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN**

Once the intended result, or _end game_, is identified, it's often a good idea to identify various completion points or decision points. This will flag the steps needed to complete the project. The methodology to use, such as Waterfall or Agile, can then be selected.

Once the key action points are known, sub-processes needed for timely completion of the activities can be defined. While these activities are being developed, they can be incorporated in whatever project management methodology is being used.

As the various activities are being defined, periodic team meetings are advisable to ensure that all team members are aligned with the project's direction. In parallel to project activities, milestones can be established, budgets defined and approved, team members advised on their assignments and responsibilities, and regular briefings set with senior management to ensure their ongoing support.

Flexibility in the structure of the methodology is important because changes to aspects of the project are inevitable. The project plan and, if used, project management software must automatically adjust time frames, budgets, staffing and other variables as changes occur.

**MANAGING RISK IN IT PROJECTS**

As with any project, risk must be accounted for. Risks can occur at any point, so the key is to accept that risks will be present, anticipate and identify them, review their likelihood and importance, and define ways to mitigate their impact.

If project management software is to be used, see if it can identify and analyze potential risks, threats and vulnerabilities that may affect the project's success. It's also advisable to perform a risk assessment before the project starts. This is where AI might be helpful; it could streamline the process and also later reassess risks.

_Project, program and portfolio management are related but represent distinct disciplines._

**IT PROJECT MANAGEMENT METHODOLOGIES**

There seem to be as many [project management methodologies](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/project-management-methodology) as there are projects. They break down into two larger camps, though: traditional and nontraditional methods. Let’s start with the traditional waterfall method, which breaks down the tasks in a project into a line of sequential project phases, and each of these phases depends on the delivery of the one before it.

Waterfall Methodology

[Waterfall](https://www.projectmanager.com/software/use-cases/waterfall-methodology) is the go-to methodology for most IT projects. While it is a project management method found in large projects outside of IT, it also lends itself to IT projects and has been proven a successful approach for formal and linear projects.

Waterfall has been around since it was codified in a paper published in 1970 by Dr. Winston W. Royce. The waterfall model has six stages:

1. **Requirements:** First, the requirements are identified, analyzed and written up in a requirements document, defining what is being done and how it is to be done. This will be reviewed by stakeholders.
2. **Design:** The next step is to document what was decided in the first stage in a design document, which notes everything needed to complete the project.
3. **Implementation:** The IT project manager and team execute the design document, sticking to specifications, procedures and timelines.
4. **Testing:** This is when deliverables from the project are measured against the standards set in the design document and stakeholders, like a quality check. If not met, then the process starts again. Our [test case template](https://www.projectmanager.com/templates/test-case-template) can help with this process.
5. **Installation:** If the tests are passed, then the project is ready for release to the end-user. The product should be fully operational at this point.
6. **Maintenance:** Most IT projects don’t end with delivery: they often require support after installation, whether updates or upgrades, though often this is tasked to a separate team.

Agile Methodology

Software development has introduced an [agile framework](https://www.projectmanager.com/ultimate-agile-guide) to projects, a more iterative approach that works in short sprints and open to pivoting throughout the project, rather than being rigidly aligned with the plan. Some IT teams have incorporated agile or some of its implementations into their own projects.

Hybrid Methodology

More popular than agile with IT teams is [hybrid methodology](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/what-is-hybrid-methodology), which combines waterfall and agile, creating a more flexible and yet structured approach that can lend itself to IT projects. This “best of both worlds” approach it can be the right path forward depending on the parameters of the project.

ProjectManager is the ideal IT project management software for waterfall or hybrid methodologies. It features online Gantt charts for waterfall enthusiasts and kanban boards for agile lovers. Plus, the real-time dashboard keeps the IT project manager updated on progress through metrics that can be filtered to show the data you want and then shared.

OTHER METHODOLOGIES

Less used in IT projects, but worth mentioning, is the critical path method and critical chain project management. The [critical path method](https://www.projectmanager.com/critical-path-method) categorizes the tasks that must be completed to fulfill the project objective. This is done with a [work breakdown structure (WBS)](https://www.projectmanager.com/work-breakdown-structure), which is then mapped across a project duration or Gantt chart, with task dependencies linked to avoid blocking teams. This helps to know which tasks need to be done when.

The critical chain project management works backwards, recognizing deliverables and using past experience to map the tasks needed to complete the project. This is a very efficient way to use resources, while staying focused on the end-goal. However, delays can be common, and it’s not suited to work on a portfolio of projects.

**IT PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOLS**

The right IT project management tools will overcome the challenges of IT projects and give project managers better control and teams the features they need to collaborate and be more productive. Fortunately, ProjectManager is a project management software designed with IT project management in mind.

Gantt Charts for Waterfall Plans

The feature that fits with IT project management like a hand in a glove is ProjectManager’s online Gantt charts. Most of the methodologies above work on the timeline of a Gantt chart, and ours will allows you to link tasks that are dependent and even assign.

Teams love our online Gantt chart, especially IT teams that tend to work collaboratively and with autonomy. That’s because they can comment at the task level. Tasks can also have documents attached or images to add supporting materials and even sign-off once they’re completed.

Dashboards for Live Reporting

Because ProjectManager is a cloud-based project management software, status updates are instantly reflected throughout the program. That means your real-time dashboard is giving you project details as they happen.

The various metrics measuring cost, workload, time and more, can be filtered to show just the amount of data you need. Then these easy-to-read colorful graphs and charts can be shared to teams and stakeholders or printed out for presentations.

**ROLES IN IT PROJECT MANAGEMENT**

Roles and responsibilities in IT project management mostly mirror those projects in other disciplines. There are stakeholders, who are those who have an interest in the project; teams, who are those with skills to execute the [project plan](https://www.projectmanager.com/project-planning); and the IT project manager, who is the person that is responsible for the planning, procurement and execution of the project.

Types of IT Teams

Where roles differ from more traditional projects is in the teams themselves. While more project management is executed by teams, whether remote or on site, they are largely part of the overall organization that is implementing the project. However, with IT project management there are three types of teams.

- First, there is the traditional **project management team** that is tasked with an IT project. These teams are not exclusive to IT and are led and staffed with a formal project management methodology.
- Second, there are **professional services teams**, who deliver technology to external customers. This is usually done with the implementation of software or installation of hardware. They are often led by a project manager, but can be headed by a services vice-president or director. However, they also use formal types of project management.
- Thirdly, there are **internal IT teams**. These are the teams that manage the delivery and maintenance of the technology in an organization. They roll out new systems, set up computers, monitors, phones and other devices for employees and manage the systems. They can be led by a project manager, though that person is usually defined within the company as a director or vice-president of IT.

THE IT PROJECT MANAGER

The IT project manager, due to the breadth of IT project management, has a wider range of responsibilities than most other project managers. They are not only dealing with leadership, resource allocation, scheduling and planning, monitoring and reporting, but must know about technology beyond the tools that they use to manage projects.

IT project managers are responsible for understanding firmware and being able to implement software integrations. They often build websites and databases, and manage these technologies as well.

However, the basic structure of the IT project manager’s job remains being a clear communicator, setting realistic goals and applying the right methodology to achieve them.

Therefore, the IT project manager, like any project manager, is concerned with setting deadlines and keeping to a budget. This is all managed through methodology.

Besides the normal problems that can cause a project to fail, factors that can negatively affect success of an IT project. These include advances in technology during the project's execution; infrastructure changes that impact security and data management; and unknown dependent relationships among hardware, software, network infrastructure and data.

IT projects might also succumb to the first-time, first-use penalty, which is the [total risk](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/total-risk) an organization assumes when implementing a new technology for the first time. Complications are likely to affect the chances of success for a first-time project.

A strong IT manager will ensure that your IT projects run smoothly, stay on track, and budget.

## Introduction to .NET

.NET is a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform for building many kinds of applications. It can run programs written in multiple languages, with C# being the most popular. 

The .NET platform has been designed to deliver productivity, performance, security, and reliability, while providing automatic memory management via a garbage collector (GC). 
- It is type-safe and memory-safe, due to using a GC and strict language compilers. 
- It offers concurrency via async/await and Task primitives. 
- It includes a large set of libraries that have broad functionality and have been optimized for performance on multiple operating systems and chip architectures.

**.NET has the following design points:**

- **Productivity** is full-stack with runtime, libraries, language, and tools all contributing to developer user experience.
- **Safe code** is the primary compute model, while unsafe code enables additional manual optimizations.
- **Static and dynamic code** are both supported, enabling a broad set of distinct scenarios.
- **Native code interop and hardware intrinsics** are low cost and high-fidelity (raw API and instruction access).
- **Code is portable across platforms** (OS and chip architecture), while platform targeting enables specialization and optimization.
- **Adaptability across programming domains** (cloud, client, gaming) is enabled with specialized implementations of the general-purpose programming model.
- **Industry standards** like OpenTelemetry and gRPC are favored over bespoke solutions.

.NET is maintained collaboratively by Microsoft and a global community. Regular updates ensure users deploy secure and reliable applications to production environments.

## C# Programming

## Conclusion

.NET is the fundamental programming platform for the Microsoft developer ecosystem, and is the foundation of professional applications big and small. Each release of .NET includes hundreds of standard code libraries and APIs that can help you build massively scalable web applications, work with various databases, and even include .NET-specific machine learning in your code.

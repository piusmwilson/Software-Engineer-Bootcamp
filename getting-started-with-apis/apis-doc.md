# Application Programming Interfaces(APIs)

As an integral part of modern development, Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) allow software applications to communicate and use functions from other software applications or services.

## What is an Application Programming Interfaces

An Application Programming Interfaces (API) is a software interface that connects different applications and systems as they share information and other resources. Its a building block that works behind the scenes to expose the resources of one software application/system to another enabling seamless intergration.

APIs, provide a manner in which software applications communicate with each other by abstracting the complexity of applications to allow developers to use only the essentials of the software they are working with.

They define the methods and data formats an application should use in order to perform tasks, like sending, retrieving, or modifying data. APIs also allow applications to exchange data and functionality with ease, thus enabling integration and convergence of technological services. 

## Business Benefits of APIs

- APIs can be a new business channel of bringing revenue to an organisation by way of monetized access to it's data and services.
- Reach and retention.
- Faster Partnerships in situations where APIs are well-documented and usable which enables partners to onboard in record time.
- APIs are Mobile and Omnichannel meaning organisations can offer their services through APIs enabling them provide consistent digital experiences across all their business channels.
- Good Interaction Analysis made possible from having customers and partners access services through APIs thus creating a digital feedback loop that enables real-time analysis of user behavior. 
- Outsourced Innovation which is where an organisation makes available a public version of their API which can lead to innovative useage from third party developers thus benefiting the API owners.
- Self-Service Integration which enables API-enabled enterprises to allow more rapid integration of disparate business capabilities and assembly of new products.
- Realisation of Organisational Agility especially where there is adoption of "API First" engineering philosophy along with a microservice architecture maximising delivery speed, system stability and scalability.

## API Design

a solid understanding of what APIs are forms the basic cornerstone of API design. 

API design, as a key part of any software development process thus,

- Its basics encompass  _understanding the principles of what an API is, how it works, and the various types of APIs, such as REST, SOAP, and GraphQL_. 
- It also includes _understanding the standards and best practices in API design to ensure the development of powerful, user-friendly, and secure APIs_. 

The foundation of API Design lies in this knowledge, setting the stage for more complex API designing and development.

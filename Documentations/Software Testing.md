# SOFTWARE TESTING & BUG MANAGEMENT

## Bug Management

Bug writing and management are critical to software development. Quality managers, developers, and everyone else associated with a product's launch are deeply invested in the process. 
Bad bugs—those with inaccurate or unclear information—lead to a lot of wasted time and effort. However, when bugs are well written and managed properly, the project runs smoother and faster.

# SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE

The Concise Software Development Lifecycle documentation guide

## TABLE OF CONTENTS

## INTRODUCTION

The Software Development Lifecyce(SDLC) is a structured framework for systematic software development following phases broadly classified into six steps namely;- _Requirements Analysis and Planning, Design, Coding,Testing, Deployment, and Maintainence._ 

from the beginning, computers and their programs have been complex systems. The first mainframe computers filled entire rooms! Organizations needed a way to manage large software projects running on those computers. 

The systems development lifecycle was born in the 1960s, and variations of the framework evolved over time into the software development lifecycle (SDLC). 


## THE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE (SDLC)

SDLC is structured Methodology for consistent development that defines the creation, development, maintainence and delivery of software. It consists of a detailed plan to develop, maintain, or enhance software that ensures quality software production.

-- The SDLC is a framework for systematically building high-quality software and websites that meet user requirements. The SDLC provides a way to plan large projects and offers a set of standard steps and deliverables for each project.

While there are many variations of the SDLC, a few common phases exist:
1. Planning
2. Design
3. Development
4. Testing
5. Launch
6. Maintenance

Review these phases to learn how they relate to web development. 

## THE SDLC PHASES

### Software Requirements Analysis and Planning

The planning phase of the SDLC aims to gather requirements from various stakeholders and analyze what is achievable. 

In this phase, all relevant information is gathered from the customer. As part of the planning process, labour and material costs are calculated, targets are estimated, project teams and leaders are proposed.

It is in this phase that feedback is gathered from the stakeholders on the requirements analysis document. Factors like, _overall purpose of the solution, users of the solution, data Inputs and outputs, Quality assurance requirements, Legal and regulatory compliance, Risk identification, Resource allocation (human & financial), and project scheduling_ are considered and documented in the [Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document]() when planning a software solution. The SRS document should be understood and approved by the relevant stakeholders of the software project as well as the Software Developers and other project team members.

### Software Design

In this phase, the requirements gathered in the SRS document are used as an imput when designing (developing) the software architecture which is reviewed by the stakeholders and software project team. The document created in this phase to be used by the developers for the coding process is referred to as the software design document (_or design document_).

### Software Coding 

Also referred to as the implementation phase, is where the developers use the Software Design Document as a baseline to code the actual Software Product. The Software Project Manager will typically assign coding assignments/tasks to developers _(teams of developers depending on the size of the software project)_ who will in turn begin the development work.

### Software Testing 

This phase typically commences when the coding is completed although some teams will follow coding practises that require test while coding. Some Software Development Teams have dedicated teams otherwise the Software Project Team will include a Software Quality Assurance personnel or Testers for this role along side the software developers.

Code created for the software product to be delivered needs to be tested thouroghly to ensire its stable, secure, and most importantly performs the necessary functions correctly as expected or specified in the SRS document. 

Software tests can be either Manual or automated or even a hybrid of both. Also in this phase, any bugs or errors discovered are reported, tracked, fixed and the code is retested until its confirmed it's working perfectly or to an user acceptable level. Some common [Software Testing]() techniques include;- Unit testing, Regression testing, integration testing, and performance testing.

In some cases a _testing environment_ that mirrors the _development, UAT and _Production environments_ is setup specifically for testing purposes. This is usually for very large Software Projects where various stakeholders are actively involved in the software product's development/improvements which is usually in a contract specific basis.

### Software Deployment 

In this phase, the software product is released into production where it's accessible to users. This can happen in stages such as release to User Acceptance Testing (UAT) environment where the customers tests it with the Software Projects team before signing off where after its released to the production environment.

### Software Maintainence

This phase is typically utilized for fixing issues as they surface after the software Product has been released to production as well as any major enhancements as needs. Issues or enhancements can be addressed immediately or documented for a planned future release as a Software Product upgrade.

Typically a documentation of all these activities is maintained with metrics being recorded and evaluated for compliance purposes.

## THE SDLC MODELS 
These are the various models used to implement the SDLC;-

### Waterfall Model

Also called a _Linear Sequencial Model_, because the output of one phase is input for the next phase meaning, the next phase only begins when the previous phase is completed.

### Iterative Model

Also called the _Iterative Incremental Model_ where the software product features are developed incrementally with the final product including all the features.

### Spiral Model

This model which has 4 phases _(Planning, Risk Analysis, Engineering & Evaluation)_ uses both the waterfall and prototype models, usually ideal for large projects. The spiral model phases are also followed iteratively.

### V-Shaped Model

Also called a Verification and Validation model, is a model where development(coding) and testing are done concurrently.

### Agile Model

The Agile model _(also a form of iterative development approach)_ focuses on a collaborative software development process over several short cycles rather than a top-down process. Teams work in cycles(sprints) of about two to four weeks long and testing happens within each sprint to minimise the risk of failure.

At the end of each sprint, a basic outcome of the software product will recieve user feedback that is factored into the next sprint and this process will repeat for every sprint cycle until the software project is completed.

### Lean Model

This model follows the application of lean principles and like agile development focus on delivery speed, reducing waste in each phase and continous improvement. 

this model is based on seven principles;-

- Eliminate waste.
- Build in quality.
- Create Knowledge.
- Defer Commitment.
- Deliver fast.
- Respect People.
- Optimize the whole.
